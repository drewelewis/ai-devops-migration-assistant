It looks like you currently have two projects on your TeamCity server:

• <Root project> (id: _Root)
• Payroll (id: Payroll)

If your goal is to migrate these projects from TeamCity to Tekton, you might begin by focusing on the concrete project (“Payroll”) since the root project is the parent container. Here are some suggested next steps:

1. Identify Build Configurations for “Payroll”
   • Each Build Configuration under the “Payroll” project represents a distinct pipeline or job in TeamCity. Gathering these configurations will help you map existing build steps to Tekton tasks and pipelines.
   • If you want a complete inventory of builds, you can retrieve them via the “TeamCityGetAllBuildsTool” function or by retrieving Project-specific information (such as VCS roots, steps, triggers, etc.).

2. Export/Review the Existing Build Steps
   • Look at the tasks that the “Payroll” build(s) run (compiling code, running tests, packaging artifacts, etc.). These steps will need to be mapped to Tekton tasks.
   • Note any environment variables, build parameters, or shared scripts used by these TeamCity builds.
   • Identify triggers (e.g., VCS triggers) that you may need to replicate in Tekton.

3. Plan Your Tekton Pipelines
   • For Tekton, each step in your current TeamCity build will typically become either its own step in a Tekton Task or a separate Task in a Tekton Pipeline.
   • Tekton uses Kubernetes as the execution environment, so ensure you have access to (or create) a namespace in a Kubernetes cluster where the Tekton pipelines will reside. You can also list your available namespaces using a Tekton tool or by kubectl (once you have that environment set up).

4. Migrate UCD (IBM UrbanCode Deploy) Processes to Harness
   • In parallel, you can also plan to move any deployment logic handled by IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD) into Harness.
   • Harness can integrate well with the output artifacts from Tekton. You’ll map your newly built artifacts (e.g., containers or other packages) to Harness-based deployments.
   • Determine which UCD pipelines and environment configurations you currently have, then map them to Harness pipelines, services, and environment definitions.

5. Iterate and Test
   • Start small by migrating one build configuration to Tekton (e.g., the “Payroll” project’s build) and one deployment process to Harness.
   • Confirm that your builds and deployments work as expected in the new environment before fully decommissioning TeamCity and UCD.       

If you need more specifics—like listing all build configurations under “Payroll,” or help figuring out how each step in a specific TeamCity build translates to Tekton steps—just let me know, and we’ll walk through the details.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

It looks like there is a single Build Configuration for Payroll in TeamCity, identified by the buildTypeId "Payroll_Build". The individual builds you see in the listing (IDs 1, 2, and 3) are runs of that Build Configuration. Here is a summary:

• Build Configuration ID: Payroll_Build
• Recent Builds: #1, #2, #3 (all with status SUCCESS)

The TeamCity REST response you see is for the three builds associated with the “Payroll_Build” Build Configuration. If you need more detailed information about the actual steps, triggers, or parameters, you would typically query TeamCity via an endpoint that returns the Build Configuration details (for example, /app/rest/buildTypes/id:Payroll_Build) or view them in the TeamCity UI.

Let me know if you want to explore the build steps or any other details for “Payroll_Build,” and I can guide you on how to retrieve them and map them to Tekton.

   • In the TeamCity UI, go to “Project Settings” → “Versioned Settings” for your “Payroll_Build.”
   • If Versioned Settings is enabled, TeamCity will generate a Kotlin DSL in a repository you specify. That DSL includes the build steps and all other TeamCity configuration details.
   • You can open that repository to see the build steps as code.

2. Use the TeamCity DSL Export
   • If Versioned Settings is not already enabled, you can do so for the Payroll project (TeamCity Docs: Enable Versioned Settings).       
   • TeamCity will export the build configuration to Kotlin DSL (usually in a .teamcity directory in your VCS).

3. Use the RAW XML approach (via REST or direct file download)
   • Another way to see the details is to retrieve the raw XML for the “Payroll_Build.” This is less friendly than Kotlin DSL but still provides the definitions for your build steps.
   • For example: GET /app/rest/latest/buildTypes/id:Payroll_Build?fields=steps might provide the step definitions in TeamCity’s internal XML format (depending on your TeamCity version and auth settings).

From there, you can:

• Map each build step (e.g., a “gradle” or “maven” runner, Docker builds, or custom command steps) to one or more Tekton steps.
• Translate environment variables, parameters, triggers, etc., into Tekton equivalents.

Let me know if you need instructions on how to map those TeamCity steps into Tekton tasks or pipelines, or if you need help enabling Versioned Settings to extract the DSL code.

I use the dohq-teamcity sdk, is it prossible to get the build definition xml using that SDK, if so can you share the code?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Below is an example of how you can retrieve the raw XML definition of a TeamCity Build Configuration using the dohq-teamcity (devopshq/teamcity) SDK in Python. Since dohq-teamcity typically returns JSON objects, the most straightforward approach is to use its underlying requests session to make a direct REST call, setting an “Accept: application/xml” header.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
from dohq_teamcity import TeamCityInstance

# 1. Instantiate the TeamCity connection
tc = TeamCityInstance(
    server_url="http://teamcity.mycompany.com",
    username="your-username",
    password="your-password"
)

# 2. Retrieve a dohq_teamcity object for your build configuration
build_type = tc.build_types.get_by_id("Payroll_Build")

# 3. Use the internal requests session to get the raw XML
api_xml_url = f"{tc.server_url}/app/rest/latest/buildTypes/id:{build_type.id}"
response = tc.session.get(api_xml_url, headers={"Accept": "application/xml"})

if response.ok:
    raw_xml = response.text
    print("Raw XML Build Configuration:\n")
    print(raw_xml)
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch build config XML. HTTP Status: {response.status_code}")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
• Step 1: You create a TeamCityInstance with your server URL and credentials.
• Step 2: Use the SDK to get the BuildType object by its ID (e.g., “Payroll_Build”).
• Step 3: Because dohq-teamcity uses an underlying requests.Session object (tc.session), you can tap directly into it to make a REST call, specifying “headers={‘Accept’: ‘application/xml’}” to request XML instead of JSON. The response’s .text will then contain the raw XML.
